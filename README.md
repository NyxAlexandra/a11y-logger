# A11y Logger

## Supported browser

This extension supports browser that are based on Chromium (such as Google Chrome,
Brave, Microsoft Edge, or Brave). While Firefox (and its derivatives) are supported,
Firefox [prevents the installation of unsigned addons](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/add-on-signing-in-firefox),
so participants are encouraged to use a Chromium-based browser for the duration of
the study.

Download `a11y-logger.zip` from the [releases page](https://github.com/NyxAlexandra/a11y-logger/releases/latest).
